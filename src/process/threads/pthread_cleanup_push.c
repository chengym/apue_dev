/*
 * The program below provides a simple example of the use of the functions described in this page.  The program creates a thread that executes a loop bracketed by  pthread_cleanup_push()  and  pthread_cleanup_pop().   This  loop
 * increments  a  global  variable,  cnt,  once  each second.  Depending on what command-line arguments are supplied, the main thread sends the other thread a cancellation request, or sets a global variable that causes the other
 * thread to exit its loop and terminate normally (by doing a return).
 * 
 * In the following shell session, the main thread sends a cancellation request to the other thread:
 * 
 *     $ ./a.out
 *     New thread started
 *     cnt = 0
 *     cnt = 1
 *     Canceling thread
 *     Called clean-up handler
 *     Thread was canceled; cnt = 0
 * 
 * From the above, we see that the thread was canceled, and that the cancellation clean-up handler was called and it reset the value of the global variable cnt to 0.
 * 
 * In the next run, the main program sets a global variable that causes other thread to terminate normally:
 * 
 *     $ ./a.out x
 *     New thread started
 *     cnt = 0
 *     cnt = 1
 *     Thread terminated normally; cnt = 2
 * 
 * From the above, we see that the clean-up handler was not executed (because cleanup_pop_arg was 0), and therefore the value of cnt was not reset.
 * 
 * In the next run, the main program sets a global variable that causes the other thread to terminate normally, and supplies a nonzero value for cleanup_pop_arg:
 * 
 *     $ ./a.out x 1
 *     New thread started
 *     cnt = 0
 *     cnt = 1
 *     Called clean-up handler
 *     Thread terminated normally; cnt = 0
 * 
 * In the above, we see that although the thread was not canceled, the clean-up handler was executed, because the argument given to pthread_cleanup_pop() was nonzero.
